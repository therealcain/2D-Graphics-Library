# 2D Graphics Library

This is 2D Graphics Library, it will allow you simulate your physics easily, or even creating
a 2D game!

This library is very easy to use, lightweight, support Windows/Linux and keeps growing!

I will make a documentation, when i will finish everything i'm planning on adding to it!
You can see todo.txt if you want to know what i'm going or maybe planning to add!
